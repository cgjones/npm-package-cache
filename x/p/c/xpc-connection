binding for node.js\n\n## Supported data types\n\n * int32/uint32\n * string\n * array\n * buffer\n * uuid\n * object\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar XpcConnection = require('xpc-connection');\n\nvar xpcConnection = new XpcConnection('<Mach service name>');\n\nxpcConnection.on('error', function(message) {\n    ...\n});\n\nxpcConnection.on('event', function(event) {\n    ...\n});\n\nxpcConnection.setup();\n\nvar mesage = {\n    ... \n};\n\nxpcConnection.sendMessage(mesage);\n```\n\n## Build Errors\n\nBefore creating a new issue for build errors, please set your path to the following:\n\n```sh\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin\n```\n\nMacPorts and other similiar tools might be adding an incompatible compiler to your PATH (see issue [#2](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-xpc-connection/issues/2)) for more
